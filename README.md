## About this game
YOU DIED. Welcome to the HEll!

In this game, you control a dead man who falls into hell with plenty of monsters. Now you must find a way outâ€¦ or stay trapped and tortured forever.

## Game Rules
1. Enjoy is the first most important :D<br>
2. Turn-based battles with your strategy<br>
2. WASD for movement control<br>
3. When HP goes zero, player dies with permadeath<br>
4. When MP goes zero, player cannot release any magic skills<br>
5. When Energy goes zero, there are random debuffs for the player. (e.g. max. strength & movement speed decrease...)<br>
6. Energy decreases when time passes/ player makes any steps.<br>

## Features
- Level-up system with skill points & experience level to upgrade player's ability <br>
- Total 10 levels in the dungeon (hell). Different levels of the dungeon offer a range of difficulty in monsters corresponding with the range of value in treasure.<br>
- Generally, the difficulty in monsters increases with procedurally generated levels of the dungeon.<br>
- Chests could be found on map.<br>
- Each level has a different theme and boss. Also, there are 5 floors for each level.<br>
- NO AUTO SAVING and permadeath(i.e. player character loses all health are considered as dead and cannot be used anymore), is included. <br>
- But there is a saving point after defeating the boss for each level.<br>
- Monsters, NPC and chests are shown in different colors.<br>
